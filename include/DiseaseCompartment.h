/* The purpose of this class is as a self-contained disease compartment,
 * which can have an arbitrary number of sub-compartments and
 * supports the needed operations that need to be done with/to it.
 *
 * Each Compartment should have a Disease Status attached to it, and
 * the Status of the Compartment it flows in to. It should also record
 * the number of sub-compartments it has, and the total number of animals in it.*/
