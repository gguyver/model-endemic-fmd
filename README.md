# Readme

### Description
This repo compiles into an epidemiological model, intended to model the spread and maintenance of Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD) in the Republic of Turkey.

It requires data on villages/farms, and recorded cattle shipments to simulate this.

---
### Inputs

The data to be imported, and options to specify aspects of the disease and control policies implemented are specified in a YAML configuration file. By default, this configuration file is named config.yaml and will be looked for in the working directory of the executable. Other names and/or locations can be specified as a CLI options, e.g. `./model-binary ../inputs/different-config.yaml`.
Three files act as inputs to the model.
1. The config.yaml file
2. A csv file describing the nodes (epi-units/villages) to be modelled, `node_file` in config.yaml.
3. A csv file describing the shipments between nodes, `shipment_file` in config.yaml

The node file should be in the format:

| ID | km north (double) | km east (double) | number of cattle (integer) |

Shipment records should be in the format:

| Day (integer) |  source node ID | target node ID | number shipped (integer) |

---
### Outputs
Outputs are written to the directory specified by `output_id`.

By default, a csv file in the tidy format is output called `$(output_id)-node-infection-report.csv`. This file describes the incidence and prevalence for each combination of:
- run
- day
- serotype
- true/detected

Optionally other descriptive files can also be output, as described in the following table:

| Filename | Configuration option | Description |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| $(output_id)-infection-events.csv | `infection_events` | A list of every transmission spread between nodes, including type of transmission event. |
| $(output_id)-global-compartment-sums.csv | `compartment_sums` | A sum of the global population in each compartment, for every run, day and serotype. |
| $(serotype)-$(run)-detailed-report.csv | `detailed_reports` | Reports the time since infected for each node, for each serotype and run. Output to $(output_directory)/detailed-reports | 

---
### Configuration
Configuration of the model takes place in the configfile. The model will look for a file named `config.yaml` in the same directory as the executable.
 Optionally, specifying a configuration file of another name and/or in another directory can be done via the CLI, such as:
`./<model> <path-to-different-config>` etc, so long as the normal options are present.

Make sure to preserve the structure of the file. E.g. `node_file:` should be under `inputs:`.
